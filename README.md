I am an experienced Security Technology Consultant and Business Development Specialist with over 28 years of expertise in the design, integration, and execution of large-scale, high-security projects across mining, renewable energy, national infrastructure, aviation, and government sectors.

My career spans ownership of multiple successful businesses and senior leadership roles, where I have consistently delivered innovative, cost-effective, and AI-enhanced security solutions tailored to complex client risk profiles. I specialize in the integration of perimeter intrusion detection (PIDS), access control, surveillance, fire detection, and advanced analytics platforms to create comprehensive, future-proof protection strategies.

Currently serving as Business Development Manager at Stallion Security, I focus on turnkey security projects within the mining and renewable energy sectors, leveraging CPTED principles, full system audits, and client-focused consultation to ensure robust, scalable solutions.

I have successfully led projects for international clients including Newmont Gold (Peru, Ghana & Suriname), FQML (Zambia), national key points such as OR Tambo & Cape Town International Airports, and high-security environments including Eskom power stations, Gautrain, Auditor General SA, and the National Assembly of Lesotho.

Recognized as a thought leader, I have authored articles in leading security publications across Africa and actively contribute to advancing integrated security system design.
